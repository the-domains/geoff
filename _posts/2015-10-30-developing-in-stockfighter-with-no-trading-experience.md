description: 'Starfighter is a company which makes fun programming challenges. One of our goals is inspiring engineers to take a whack at problems they might assume are "too difficult for me." Both sets of levels for our first game, Stockfighter, give copious opportunities for this: one set has you do algorithmic trading and one set has you do low-level C and assembly coding, reverse engineering, and security research.'
